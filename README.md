### Before running the application, you need to configure some environment variables:

2. Set the following variables in the .env file:
```
DATABASE="connection string to mongodb"

```
> [!NOTE]
> You can check the repository for an idea of what these values should be. The JWTSECRET can be any string.

## Running the Application
1. Start the backend server using nodemon. Note the port that the server is running on (usually port 5000).

2. In the frontend directory, create a .env file and set your private IP address and the port number where the backend is hosted. For example: 192.168.*.*:5000.

```
This will allow you to test your application in mobile phones which are connected in the same network.
```
3. Run the application:
```
npm run
```
> **NOTE:** You can also set up a command to run both programs concurrently.

> **IMPORTANT:** Before you begin exploring the user interface, itâ€™s best to create a seller account and post some products which will be shown in the user interface.
